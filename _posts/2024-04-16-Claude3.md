### Abstract

- 三个模型定位，由强到弱：

Claude 3 Opus, our most capable offering

Claude 3 Sonnet, which provides a combination of skills and speed

Claude 3 Haiku, our fastest and least expensive model

- 多模态能力：

All new models have vision capabilities that enable them to process and analyze image data.



### Intro

训练技术：unsupervised learning、Constitutional AI[^2][^3]

Function Calling能力据说是可以的：The model family also excels at tool use, also known as function calling, allowing seamless integration of Claude’s intelligence into specialized applications and custom workflows.



### Multimodal
